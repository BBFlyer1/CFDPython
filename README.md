# CFDPython
<strong>Note:</strong>The material in the lessons notebooks is modified from that provided by Professor Barba as a result BBFlyer1 learning this material.  BBFlyser is just learning Python, LaTex, NumPy,, etc and has added elements (in both markdown and code cells in the notebooks) to clarify the professor's information to reflect some of this learning. For definitive work refer to the original Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub at https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython and associate YouTube videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30F4C5ABCE62CB61 The original notebooks for CFDPython were part of a Boston University Mechanical Engineering class ME702 by Lorena A Barba betwen 2009 and 2013, I think.  After working through the first 2-3 examples, I discovered I needed to change the structure of the project, so the Jupyter Notebooks I orizinally loaded have been deleted.  

This code is written in Python using Junyper Notebooks.  The Python compiler, Jupyter Notebooks, and associated files were downloaded from [Anaconda3(64 bit)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) onto  a Windows 10 environment.

The code in this repository is based on part of a class taught by Professor Lorena Barba between 2009 and 2013 in the Mechanical Engineering department of Boston University. ([Professor Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/) has since moved to George Washington University) The original set of Jupyter notebooks was written in 2013 to teach an intensive two-day course in Mendoza, Argentina.
