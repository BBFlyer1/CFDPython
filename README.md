# CFDPython
Derived from the CFDPython module of a Boston University Mechanical Engineering class ME702 by Lorena A Barba.  After working through the first 2-3 examples, I discovered I needed to change the structure of the project, so the Jupyter Notebooks I orizinally loaded have been deleted.  I plan to add the new structure today, and add the additional files as I complete them.

This code has been modified from that given in the source as part of the learning experience.  The code is written in Python using Junyper Notebooks Using [Anaconda3(64 bit)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on Windows 10.

The code in this repository is based on part of a class taught by Professor Lorena Barba between 2009 and 2013 in the Mechanical Engineering department of Boston University. ([Professor Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/) has since moved to George Washington University) The original set of Jupyter notebooks was written in 2013 to teach an intensive two-day course in Mendoza, Argentina.
